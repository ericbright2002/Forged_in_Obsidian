# Shields
### Module


## Abilities:
- [ ] When you raise your shields, roll +your vehicle's integrity or +wits. On a strong hit, set your shields to 4. On a weak hit, make them 3. On a miss, make them 2 but [Lose Momentum](Moves/suffer/lose_momentum) (-1). Then, if you [Withstand Damage](Moves/suffer/withstand_damage), ignore damage up to the value of your shields and suffer -1 shields. Raised shields last for a few minutes. If reduced to 0, they cannot be raised again for an hour or so.

- [ ] You may [React Under Fire](Moves/combat/react_under_fire) by letting your shields take the blow. If you do, roll +shields and take +2 momentum on a hit.

- [ ] When you [Enter the Fray](Moves/combat/enter_the_fray) and score a strong hit, you may raise your shields to 3 without rolling. If you do, take +1 momentum.
