# Expanded Hold
### Module


## Abilities:
- [ ] Your vehicle carries up to 3 cargo. When you gain +supply, you may convert it to +cargo. When you make a move +supply, you may add +cargo. When you [Sacrifice Resources](Moves/suffer/sacrifice_resources), you may instead suffer -cargo for any portion of the cost.

- [ ] When you score a miss or weak hit as you make a move to barter or negotiate, and you have at least 1 cargo, you may sweeten the pot. If you do, reroll all dice and add +cargo. Then, suffer -1 cargo.

- [ ] When you make a move to outrun a threat and have at least 1 cargo, you may first lighten your load by dropping cargo. If you do, suffer -cargo by the amount dropped, add +that amount, and take +2 momentum on a hit.
