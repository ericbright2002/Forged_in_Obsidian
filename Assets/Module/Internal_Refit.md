# Internal Refit
### Module


## Abilities:
- [ ] You have customized the cabins, common spaces, and environment of the ship to your needs. When you [Undertake an Expedition](Moves/exploration/undertake_an_expedition) (dangerous or greater), reroll any dice for the first leg of your journey. On a hit, you and your allies may envision how you make yourself at home; if you do, take +2 momentum or +1 spirit.

- [ ] Your vessel is stocked with reserves. When you [Sacrifice Resources](Moves/suffer/sacrifice_resources) and your supply is reduced to 0, first roll +integrity instead of marking unprepared. On a strong hit, take +1 supply. Otherwise, mark unprepared.

- [ ] When you [Enter the Fray](Moves/combat/enter_the_fray) to oppose an invader within your vessel, reroll any dice. On a strong hit, take +momentum equal to integrity. On a strong hit with a match, also mark progress.
