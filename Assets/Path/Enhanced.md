### Path


## Abilities:


- [ ] Your DNA was spliced with that of another species, known or unknown. Envision a permanent change this bestows upon your body and how others react to it when they find out. When you make a move directly aided by this change, add +1. On a strong hit, take +2 momentum. On a miss with a match, [Endure Harm](Moves/Suffer/Endure_Harm) (-2) as your body temporarily rejects the DNA.

- [ ] A second change permanently affects your body as above, but the benefits of the two changes do not stack.

- [ ] Encoded in your altered DNA is something that could change humanity forever. If you [Swear an Iron Vow](Moves/Quest/Swear_an_Iron_Vow) to uncover this change (rank extreme or epic), reroll any dice. When you [Fulfill Your Vow](Moves/Quest/Fulfill_Your_Vow) and score a hit, mark two boxes on your discoveries legacy track.
