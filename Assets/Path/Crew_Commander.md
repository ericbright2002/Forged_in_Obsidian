# Crew Commander
### Path


## Abilities:
- [ ] You have 2 command; your max is 4. When you or an ally make a move leading or aided by your crew, you may (after rolling) suffer -1 command and improve a miss to a weak hit, or a weak hit to a strong hit. When you [Pay the Price](Moves/fate/pay_the_price), you may suffer the cost as -1 command. If you [Face Danger](Moves/adventure/face_danger) as a test of your leadership, roll +command. To bolster your crew, provide a significant reward or respite; then, roll +heart. On a strong hit, take +4 command. On a weak hit, take +2. On a miss, take +2 but envision a threat to your crew or leadership.

- [ ] Take +2 command; your max is now 6.

- [ ] When your command is 0 and the situation desperate, you may [Compel](Moves/adventure/compel) your crew to action; if you do, take +2 command on a hit.
