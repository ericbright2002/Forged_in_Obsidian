- [ ] You are haunted by the spirit of someone whose death you caused or mourn (or both). When you make a move to call upon their insight, add +1. On a weak hit, also [Endure Stress](Moves/suffer/endure_stress) (-1). On a strong hit with a match, mark 1 tick on your bonds legacy track.

- [ ] When you [Face Death](Moves/threshold/face_death) guided by the spirit, add +1. On a strong hit, envision what you learn from them or about them, and mark 2 ticks on your bonds legacy track.

- [ ] One time only, when you [Fulfill Your Vow](Moves/quest/fulfill_your_vow) (extreme or greater) in service to the spirit, take this ability at no cost and choose one.

 * Let them go: Mark 2 ticks on your bonds legacy track for each marked ability, and discard this asset.
 * Bolster your link: When you use a HAUNTED asset ability, take +1 momentum on a hit.
