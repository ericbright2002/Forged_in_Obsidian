# Armored
### Path


## Abilities:
- [ ] When you [Face Danger](Moves/adventure/face_danger), [React Under Fire](Moves/combat/react_under_fire), or [Clash](Moves/combat/clash) against physical attacks or impact, you may put trust in your armor’s strength. If you do, preset your action die to 4. On a strong hit with a match, take +2 momentum as you build confidence, make an impression on your foes, or improve your position.

- [ ] You add an important new piece to your set of armor, or upgrade its materials. As above, but preset your action die to 5 instead of 4.

- [ ] When you must [Endure Harm](Moves/suffer/endure_harm), you may instead let your armor take the hit. If you do, roll your action die. On a 4 or greater, ignore the harm. On a 1-3, ignore the harm but your armor is now broken; you must [Repair](Moves/recover/repair) and spend 5 repair points to bring it back to working condition.
