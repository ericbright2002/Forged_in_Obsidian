# Cosmic Constructor
### Path


## Abilities:


- [ ] You can mold cosmic energy into small, basic shapes with a physical form that last from a few moments to a few minutes. When you rest and meditate to gather this energy, roll +spirit. On a strong hit, take up to +3 energy. On a weak hit, take +2. On a miss, take +2 energy but [Endure Harm](Moves/Suffer/Endure_Harm) (-2). Your max energy is +5. When you make moves aided by your constructs to attack or overcome obstacles, add +2 and suffer -1 energy.

- [ ] As above, but your constructs may be medium sized with multiple shapes.

- [ ] As above, but your constructs may be larger, more intricate, more durable or longer lasting. If they are, suffer -2 energy when used instead of -1.
