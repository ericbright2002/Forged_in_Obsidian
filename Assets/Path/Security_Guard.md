# Security Guard
### Path


## Abilities:


- [ ] When you [Swear an Iron Vow](Moves/Quest/Swear_an_Iron_Vow) to provide someone or something protection for a time, set aside an action die with a value of 6. Then, when you [Face Danger](Moves/Adventure/Face_Danger) to protect that person or thing from harm, add an amount equal to half the die value (rounded up) and reduce its value by 1. When the die would reduce to 0, remove it.

- [ ] Your training in security comes in handy during a fight. When you [Strike](Moves/Combat/Strike) or [Clash](Moves/Combat/Clash) in close quarters in order to incapacitate your foe without hurting them, boost.

- [ ] When you [Gather Information](Moves/Adventure/Gather_Information) by attempting to intuit the intentions or motives of a potential threat to someone or something you protect, you may rely on your instincts. If you do, roll +heart with advantage. If on a strong hit a threat is uncovered, take +2 momentum and add +1 to your next move.
