## Abilities:
- [ ] When you make a move to attack, destroy, or sabotage by deploying or triggering an explosive device, choose the value of your charge before rolling: normal&#x3D;1, high&#x3D;2, or overcharged&#x3D;3. If either challenge die is equal to or less than the charge, count a weak hit as a strong hit. If not, and your action die is equal to or less than the charge, you are caught up in the destruction or set off an unintended effect; count a weak hit as a miss.

- [ ] When you make a move to craft, modify, or disarm an explosive device, or if you threaten or provoke by arming an explosive device, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.

- [ ] When your momentum is at its max, you may reset momentum (before rolling) to trigger an explosive device as you [Take Decisive Action](Moves/combat/take_decisive_action). If you do, reroll any challenge dice.
