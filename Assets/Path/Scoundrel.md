# Scoundrel
### Path


## Abilities:
- [ ] When you make a move by lying, bluffing, stealing, or cheating, add +2. On a strong hit with a match, your deception creates an unexpected opportunity; take the value of your shadow as +momentum.

- [ ] When you [Make a Connection](Moves/connection/make_a_connection) to search out a new contact, you may roll +shadow. If you do, reroll any dice on a miss and envision how your reputation or underworld contacts lead you to a disreputable connection.

- [ ] When you make a quick escape or con your way out of a situation and burn momentum to gain a strong hit, take +1 momentum after you reset. If you envision how this momentary success leaves you fated for future trouble, mark 2 ticks on your quests legacy track.
