### Path


## Abilities:
- [ ] When you target a minor foe from a distance (outside of a fight), roll +wits. On a strong hit, they are out of action. If other foes remain and you [Enter the Fray](Moves/combat/enter_the_fray) against them, mark progress. On a weak hit, as above, but you sacrifice time or position; [Lose Momentum](Moves/suffer/lose_momentum) (-1). On a miss, you draw attention or face a reprisal; [Pay the Price](Moves/fate/pay_the_price).

- [ ] When you [Strike](Moves/combat/strike) from a distance with time enough to line up your shot, you may roll +wits. If you do, mark progress on a strong hit.

- [ ] When you [Secure an Advantage](Moves/adventure/secure_an_advantage) by studying a distant situation through your rifle scope, or [Gain Ground](Moves/combat/gain_ground) by taking careful aim, you may sacrifice time for greater certainty. If you do (decide before rolling), [Lose Momentum](Moves/suffer/lose_momentum) (-1, -2, or -3) and add that amount. Then, take +1 momentum on a strong hit.
