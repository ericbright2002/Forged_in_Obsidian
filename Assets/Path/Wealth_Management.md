# Wealth Management
### Path


## Abilities:


- [ ] When you [Swear an Iron Vow](Moves/Quest/Swear_an_Iron_Vow) to complete a job for payment, reroll any dice.  When you [Fulfill Your Vow](Moves/Quest/Fulfill_Your_Vow), take +wealth equal to the rank of the vow.  If you leverage wealth on a move, add +wealth and suffer -1 wealth.  Additionally, you may suffer -6 wealth to clear the Indebted burden or to make a game-changing investment.

- [ ] When in a place you can [Resupply](Moves/Recover/Resupply), you may either suffer -2 wealth and take +1 supply or suffer -2 supply and take +1 wealth.

- [ ] When you search a wreck, ruin, or abandoned site for something of monetary value, roll +wits twice and keep the lower action die value.  On a hit, take +1 wealth.  On a strong hit, make it +2.
