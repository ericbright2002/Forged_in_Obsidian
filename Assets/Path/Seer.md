### Path


## Abilities:
- [ ] When you envision experiencing a prophetic dream, you may [Ask the Oracle](Moves/fate/ask_the_oracle) for details using an interpretive oracle such as Action/Theme or Descriptor/Focus. If you record the answer, and later face a situation which gives truth to the vision, take an automatic strong hit (one time only) when making a move to act on your foresight. Then, clear the prophecy. Only one prophecy can be active at a time.

- [ ] When you focus or meditate to [Gather Information](Moves/adventure/gather_information) about a place, being, or situation (in person or remotely), roll +spirit and take +1 momentum on a hit.

- [ ] When you or an ally roll a match as you [Sojourn](Moves/recover/sojourn) in a community or [Undertake an Expedition](Moves/exploration/undertake_an_expedition) within a site, you may envision gaining sudden and unbidden insight about the location. If you do, take +2 momentum.
