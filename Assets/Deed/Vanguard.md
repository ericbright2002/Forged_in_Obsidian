### Deed


## Abilities:
- [ ] When you seek a safe location in a remote environment, make a progress roll against your discoveries legacy track. On a strong hit, you establish a haven; add +2 whenever you make a recovery move at that location. On a weak hit, as above, but add +1 when making a recovery move. On a miss, you are drawn into a bad situation and must [Pay the Price](Moves/fate/pay_the_price). If you establish a haven but score a miss on a recovery move, that location is no longer safe.

- [ ] When you make a move +wits and score a strong hit with a match, your hard-won experience lends insight; take +1 momentum.

- [ ] When you [Endure Stress](Moves/suffer/endure_stress), you may roll +wits. If you do, take +1 momentum on a hit.
