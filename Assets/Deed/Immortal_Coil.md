# Immortal Coil
### Deed


## Abilities:
Once you [Fulfill Your Vow](Moves/Quest/Fulfill_Your_Vow) (rank
extreme or epic) to transfer your consciousness to an artificial body…

- [ ] You no longer benefit from [Heal](Moves/Recover/Heal). Instead, you must [Repair](Moves/Recover/Repair) to regain health as a mechanical companion would. Also, add the following options to spend repair points
     * Clear wounded: 2 points
     * Clear permanently harmed: 4 points

- [ ] Your command vehicle can store a copy of your consciousness. When you take several hours, you may update your back-up. You may also selectively erase memories with this process. If you do, [Endure Stress](Moves/Suffer/Endure_Stress) (-2).

- [ ] Your command vehicle houses a simulacrum printer. When you die, a subspace signal stops pinging your ship. If your ship survives and detects the signal loss, its systems will automatically take a day or so to install your saved consciousness into a new body.
