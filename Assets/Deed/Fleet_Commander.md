# Fleet Commander
### Deed


## Abilities:
- [ ] Your fleet has a starting and max power of 4. When you make a move as a fleetwide action to get in position, avoid a hazard, or fight, roll +power. If you [Pay the Price](Moves/fate/pay_the_price) and your fleet bears the cost, suffer -1 power. At 0 power, mark the fleet as wrecked. To refit the fleet, [Sojourn](Moves/recover/sojourn) and forego an automatic strong hit on a recover move to take +2 power; if the fleet is wrecked, first spend 2 experience to clear that status.

- [ ] Take +2 power and set your max power to 5.

- [ ] When you [Undertake an Expedition](Moves/exploration/undertake_an_expedition), you may reroll your action die if its value is less than your fleet’s power.
