# The Kraken
### Companion
### Name:
<hr>

## Abilities:
- [ ] When you summon the Kraken, fill one segment of a four-segment clock. The Kraken will heed a single command to destroy or overcome any foe or obstacle. If you are in a fight, [Take Decisive Action](Moves/combat/take_decisive_action) with an automatic strong hit. When the clock is filled, [Ask the Oracle](Moves/fate/ask_the_oracle) (using the yes/no table) if the Kraken turns against you, making it *50/50*. On a yes, discard this asset; the Kraken is now an epic foe. On a no, clear one segment of the clock.

- [ ] When you make a move using a threat to call the Kraken as leverage, add +2.

- [ ] One time only, when you [Fulfill Your Vow](Moves/quest/fulfill_your_vow) (formidable or greater) in service to the Kraken and score a hit, choose one: clear all clock segments, or discard this asset and mark three boxes on your bonds legacy track.
