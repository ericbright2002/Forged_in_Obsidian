# Rockhorn
### Companion
### Name:
<hr>

## Abilities:
- [ ] Your rockhorn companion uses its resilient, stone-like hide and brute strength to overcome threats. When you make a move by sending the rockhorn to directly attack a foe or smash an obstacle, roll +its health.

- [ ] When you make the [Companion Takes a Hit](Moves/suffer/companion_takes_a_hit) move for the rockhorn, count a weak hit as a strong hit. On a strong hit with a match, its rapid healing makes it unstoppable; give it another +1 health or take +1 momentum.

- [ ] The rockhorn will come to your aid in your most vulnerable moments. When you [Endure Harm](Moves/suffer/endure_harm) or [Endure Stress](Moves/suffer/endure_stress) and score a miss, you may reroll your action die if its value is less than the rockhorn’s health.
