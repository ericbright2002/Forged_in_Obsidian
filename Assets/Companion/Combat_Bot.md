### Companion
### Name:
<hr>

## Abilities:
- [ ] Your combat bot companion fights at your side. When you [Strike](Moves/combat/strike) aided by the bot, add +1; if you [Clash](Moves/combat/clash), take +1 momentum on a hit.

- [ ] When you use the threat of violence to [Compel](Moves/adventure/compel) or [Gain Ground](Moves/combat/gain_ground) while the bot brings its weapons to bear, you may roll +its health. If you do, take +1 momentum on a hit. On a strong hit with a match, the bot's display is especially persuasive; take another +1 momentum.
