## Notes

These space pirates might be from a faction, so I've used an Inline Script command to roll the oracles for a faction as follows:

;;faction

> [!oracle]- Faction: Exalted Republic
> **Dominion:** Diplomacy
> **Influence:** Dominant
> **Leadership:** Disputed leadership
> **Quirk:** Conceals individual identity
> **Project:** Disrupt the operations of a rival
> **Rumor:** Suffering a shortage of key workers or personnel
