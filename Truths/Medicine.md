# Medicine
- [ ]  **1-33**  **Our advanced medical technologies and expertise was lost during the Exodus.** 
 
Healers are rare and ill-equipped. Untold numbers have succumbed to sickness, injury, and disease. Those who survive often bear the scars of a hard and dangerous life in the Forge.

*Quest Starter: A respected leader has fallen ill, stricken by a sickness eradicated in the years after the Exodus. A vaccine was once available, but the only remaining samples are held in a research outpost on a remote ocean world, long-ago seized by a dangerous foe. What is your relationship to the sickened leader, and what foe stands in your way?*

- [ ]  **34-67**  **To help offset a scarcity of medical supplies and knowledge, the resourceful technicians we call riggers create basic organ and limb replacements.** 
 
Much was lost in the Exodus, and what remains of our medical technologies and expertise is co-opted by the privileged and powerful. For most, advanced medical care is out of reach. When someone suffers a grievous injury, they’ll often turn to a rigger for a makeshift mechanical solution.

*Quest Starter: A rigger is in desperate need of a rare technological artifact to create a life-saving medical device. Their patient is someone important to you, and won’t survive more than a few days. What is the nature of this artifact, and what protects it?*

- [ ]  **68-100**  **Orders of sworn healers preserve our medical knowledge and train new generations of caregivers.** 
 
Life-saving advanced care is available within larger communities throughout the settled sectors of the Forge. Even remote communities are often served by a novice healer, or can request help from a healer’s guild in an emergency.

*Quest Starter: A reactor exploded at a remote settlement, killing several and exposing many others to lethal radiation. A team of healers en route to provide aid were captured by raiders. What do the raiders demand for their release?*
