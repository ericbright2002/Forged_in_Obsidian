# Aid Your Ally

**When you act in direct support of an ally**, envision how you aid them. Then, [Secure an Advantage](Moves/Adventure/Secure_an_Advantage) or [Gain Ground](Moves/Combat/Gain_Ground) to take action. If you score a hit, they (instead of you) take the benefits of the move.

If you [Gain Ground](Moves/Combat/Gain_Ground) and score a strong hit, you are both in control. On a **weak hit**, your ally is in control but you are in a bad spot.
