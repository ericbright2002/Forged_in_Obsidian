# Take Decisive Action

*Progress Move*

**When you seize an objective in a fight**, envision how you take decisive action. Then, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress.

If you are in control, check the result as normal. If you are in a bad spot, count a strong hit without a match as a weak hit, and a weak hit as a miss.

On a **strong hit**, you prevail. Take +1 momentum. If any objectives remain and the fight continues, you are in control.

On a **weak hit**, you achieve your objective, but not without cost. Roll on the table below or choose one. If the fight continues, you are in a bad spot.

Roll   | Result
-------|--------
1-40   | It’s worse than you thought: Make a [suffer move](#Suffer-Moves) (-2)
41-52  | Victory is short-lived: A new peril or foe appears
53-64  | You face collateral damage: Something is lost, damaged, or broken
65-76  | Others pay the price: Someone else suffers the cost
77-88  | Others won’t forget: You are marked for vengeance
89-100 | It gets complicated: The true nature of a foe or objective is revealed

On a **miss**, you are defeated or your objective is lost. [Pay the Price](Moves/Fate/Pay_the_Price).
