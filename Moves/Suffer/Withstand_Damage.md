# Withstand Damage

**When your vehicle faces a damaging situation or environment**, suffer -1 integrity for minor damage, -2 for serious damage, or -3 for major damage. If your integrity is 0, [Lose Momentum](Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) equal to any remaining damage.

Then, if your integrity is 0 or you choose to resist the damage, roll +integrity.

On a **strong hit**, choose one.

  * Bypass: If your vehicle is not battered, take +1 integrity
  * Ride it out: Take +1 momentum

On a **weak hit**, if your vehicle is not battered, you may [Lose Momentum](Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-1) in exchange for +1 integrity. Otherwise, press on.

On a **miss**, it’s worse than you thought. Suffer an additional -1 integrity or [Lose Momentum](Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-2). If your integrity is 0, also suffer a cost according to the vehicle type.

  * **Command vehicle:** Mark the vehicle as **battered** or **cursed**, mark a module as **broken**, destroy a broken module by discarding it, or roll on the table below. If the command vehicle is destroyed, [Overcome Destruction](Moves/Threshold/Overcome_Destruction).
  * **Support vehicle:** Mark the vehicle as **battered** or roll on the table below. If the vehicle is destroyed, discard the asset.
  * **Incidental vehicle:** Roll on the table below.

56-70  | The vehicle is crippled or out of your control. To get it back in action, you must [Repair](Moves/Recover/Repair) and raise its integrity above 0.
