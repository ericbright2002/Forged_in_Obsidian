# Endure Harm

**When you face physical injury, fatigue, or illness**, suffer -1 health for minor harm, -2 for serious harm, or -3 for major harm. If your health is 0, [Lose Momentum](Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) equal to any remaining harm.

Then, if your health is 0 or you choose to resist the harm, roll +health or +iron, whichever is higher.

On a **strong hit**, choose one.

  * Shake it off: If you are not wounded, take +1 health
  * Embrace the pain: Take +1 momentum

On a **weak hit**, if you are not wounded, you may [Lose Momentum](Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-1) in exchange for +1 health. Otherwise, press on.

On a **miss**, it’s worse than you thought. Suffer an additional -1 health or [Lose Momentum](Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-2). If your health is 0, you must also mark wounded or permanently harmed, or roll on the table below.

Roll   | Result
-------|---------
1-10   | You suffer mortal harm. [Face Death](Moves/Threshold/Face_Death).
11-20  | You are dying. Within an hour or two, you must [Heal](Moves/Recover/Heal) and raise your health above 0, or [Face Death](Moves/Threshold/Face_Death).
21-35  | You are unconscious and out of action. If left alone, you come back to your senses in an hour or two. If you are vulnerable to ongoing harm, [Face Death](Moves/Threshold/Face_Death).
36-50  | You are reeling. If you engage in any vigorous activity before taking a breather, roll on this table again (before resolving the other move).
51-100 | You are still standing.
